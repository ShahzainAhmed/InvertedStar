## Inverted Star Pattern:
### The program takes a number n and prints an inverted star pattern of the desired size.

## Problem Solution:
- Take a value from the user and store it in a variable n.
- Use a for loop where the value of i ranges between the values of n-1 and 0 with a decrement of 1 with each iteration.
- Multiply empty spaces with n-i and ‘*’ with i and print both of them.

## Program Explanation:
-  User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
